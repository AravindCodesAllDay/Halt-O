      Recycling in Our Parking Areas
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are committed to sustainability by incorporating recycled plastics into
      our parking lot infrastructure. Hereâ€™s how we do it:

      class="w-full sm:hidden"
    />
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-5">
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Shredding:</span> Recycled plastics are
        shredded into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold"> Heating:</span> The shredded plastics are
        combined with heated blue metal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Melting:</span> The mixture is melted with
        brick jelly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Adding Bitumen:</span> Bitumen is added to
        the melted mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Laying the Road:</span> The final mixture is
        laid down to create the parking area surface.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using recycled plastics in our parking lots helps reduce waste and
      promotes a circular economy.
